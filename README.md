# ECMAScript 2015 Template Playground

This is a repo where I play around with ECMAScript 2015 templates, to see how they make things easier.. Yes, I call it "ECMAScript2015" or "ES2015" instead of ES6 since "ECMAScript2015" is the official name.

I probably could of just put this in a Gist but I may play with ES2015 templates more than I'm doing now. So I'm putting stuff in a repo for now.

A short blog post about this will (probably) be coming soon.
