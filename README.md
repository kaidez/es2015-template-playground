# ECMAScript 2015 Template Playground

This is a repo where I play around with ECMAScript 2015 templates, to see if they make things easier. Yes, I call it "ECMAScript2015" or "ES2015" instead of ES6 since "ECMAScript2015" is the official name.

I probably could of put this in a Gist but I may play with ES2015 templates more than I'm doing now. So I'm putting stuff in a repo for now, with the assumption that it will come to contain more content than what could reasonably go in a Gist.
